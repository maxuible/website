        <h3>Deciding the VPS</h3>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>
            I like the idea of creating from "scratch" and simple HTML.
            Also I wanted cost to be low, as this is mostly a learning exercise. So I chose Oracle Cloud Free Tier.
        </p>
        <h4>Caveats</h4>
        <p>
            I don't expect this site's traffic to require a lot of computing/bandwidth.
            In the future I might change hosting services, but with the experiences gained from setting up this website up changing will be easier.

        <h3>Setting Up the VPS</h3>

        <h4>
            The "Stack" used:
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                VPS Service : Oracle Cloud
            </li>
            <li>
                Host OS : Ubuntu
            </li>
            <li>
                Web Server : nginx
            </li>
            <li>
                DNS Service : Google Domains
            </li>
            <li>
                SSL Certification : Certbot/LetsEncrypt 
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            This is the simplest way I could find to set up a static website without using an all in one service like WordPress.
            I am also using git to pull changes from a GitHub repository.
        </p>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
            The biggest issue I had while setting up the website was remembering to open up the HTTPS port(443) on the VCN(Virtual Cloud Network) in Oracle Cloud.
            I had the HTTP port(80) open and was stumped on why it wasn't working for a few hours. After sleeping on it and realizing the problem, It was simple fix.
